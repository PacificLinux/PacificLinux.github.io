                  Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we

                  We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling
                  Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data
                  processing agreement with you in which case you would be the

                  Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation
                  involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a
                  data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal
                  Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of
                  the Website and Services. In such instances, we are a data
                  controller because we determine the purposes and means of the

                <p>
                  We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when
                  you submit Personal Information through the Website and
                  Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the
                  submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information
                  is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In

                  In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or
                  to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use
                  certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the
                  information that we request, we may not be able to provide you
                  with the requested products or services. Any of the

                <p>
                  Processing your Personal Information depends on how you
                  interact with the Website and Services, where you are located
                  in the world and if one of the following applies: (a) you have
                  given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (b)
                  provision of information is necessary for the performance of
                  this Policy with you and/or for any pre-contractual
                  obligations thereof; (c) processing is necessary for
                  compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject;
                  (d) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                  public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                  vested in us; (e) processing is necessary for the purposes of
                  the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

                  Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
                  information until you object to such processing by opting out,
                  without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal
                  bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific
                  legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
                  whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory
                  or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
                  enter into a contract.

                <p>
                  Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals
                  to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online
                  activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or
                  collecting information in connection with a website. For these
                  purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally
                  identifiable information from users who use or visit a website
                  or online service as they move across different websites over
                  time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not
                  yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet
                  set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals
                  communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more
